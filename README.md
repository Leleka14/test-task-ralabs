# Test-Task-Ralabs
## This is first version of test task, I've realised that it is not very efficient and comfortable in usage so I rebuilt it without redux and with other layout that is much more pleasing to the eye. Link to it https://github.com/Leleka14/test-task-ralabs2

## General Info
This project is my test task for Ralabs company. It is a simple website built with React and Redux that allows you to see weather forecast in your current location or any other city. I've also used Bootstrap, Reactstrap and Font-awesome to make it look more user-friendly. I've fetched data about weather from https://www.weatherbit.io and defined user's current position using http://api.positionstack.com APIs.
